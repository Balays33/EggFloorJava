     * A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.
     * If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. 
     * If it is dropped from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.
     * Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking, with as few drops as possible.
